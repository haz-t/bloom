# Bloom: A Meditative Flower Ritual for Doodles Jam

Welcome to **Bloom**â€”a soft, ephemeral garden of remembrance and play, built for the Doodles Jam.

In this tiny, radical game, each flower you plant is a prayer: a daily altar of grief, hope, and gentle delight. Using the official Doodles art as seeds, **Bloom** invites players to nurture these pastel spirits through slow, intentional touchâ€”transforming static pixels into a living ceremony.

This is not just a game. This is a collective breath. A refusal of rush. A reclamation of tenderness.

## How It Works

- **Touch & Hold** anywhere on screen to water your bloom.
- **Watch** as your flower grows from seed to blossomâ€”animated in soft, organic transitions.
- **Sway** with each gentle milestone: haptic feedback echoes your care.
- **Share** your garden as a quiet invitation for others to tend theirs.
- **Repeat** dailyâ€”this is a ritual of ephemeral beauty, not endless grind.

## Technologies

- **HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript** â€” everything in one sacred file.
- **9:16 Portrait Canvas** â€” for your phoneâ€™s secret chapel.
- **Gentle particle effects** â€” pollen and sparkles dancing like breath.
- **Smooth color transitions** â€” evoking sunrise, sunset, soft dusk.
- **No extraction, no exploitation** â€” only offerings of beauty.

May this garden remind you of whatâ€™s possible in the smallest, slowest gestures.  
May each bloom you water heal something tender in you.  
May we play, together, beyond empire.
